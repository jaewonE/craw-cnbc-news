Baidu AI Cloud will be integrating its Ernie chatbot into Samsung's Galaxy S24 smartphones, allowing users to translate calls in real time, among other features.
Ernie is the Chinese tech giant's answer to OpenAI's ChatGPT, aÂ chatbot powered by artificial intelligence technology that's able to generate humanlike responses to users' prompts.
It comes a week after Samsung revealed its latest Galaxy S24 lineup with AI-powered features as the South Korean electronics giant attempts to overtake the likes of Apple's newest iPhones with the technology.
