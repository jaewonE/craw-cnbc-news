BARCELONA â€” Xiaomi launched its flagship smartphone globally on Sunday as it looks to keep up its recovery momentum, while also debuting its electric vehicle for the first time in Europe.
The Chinese electronics giant launched the Xiaomi 14 for global markets at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, after debuting it this week in China.
Xiaomi found success after its founding in 2010 thanks to selling high-spec and low priced smartphones. But with that section of the market getting more competitive, Xiaomi has looked to push into the higher end of the market, where Apple and Samsung are particularly dominant, but where growth has remained despite a difficult overall phone industry.
