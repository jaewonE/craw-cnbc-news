BARCELONA, Spain â€” Samsung's Galaxy Ring, its latest wearable, is launching with health-tracking features including heart rate and sleep monitoring while also giving users a score of their readiness for the day, a top executive told CNBC.
In a wide-ranging interview, Hon Pak, head of the digital health team at Samsung Electronics, discussed the company's first foray into the product category of rings, considerations for a subscription model for the Samsung Health app and his vision for an artificial intelligence "coach."
Samsung teased the Galaxy Ring in January during the news conference when it launched the S24 smartphone. The South Korean tech giant is putting it on display for the first time at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, which kicks off Monday.
