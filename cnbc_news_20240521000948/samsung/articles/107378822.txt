BARCELONA, Spain — Honor will launch a foldable flip phone this year, the company's CEO told CNBC, marking the Chinese technology firm's first foray into the vertical-folding style of smartphone that has been popularized by brands like Samsung and Motorola.
"Foldables" refer to smartphones with displays that bend. There are two styles right now on the market — smartphones that fold like a book and those that fold vertically like an old school flip phone but without a visible hinge.
The move to launch a flip foldable is in line with Honor's push into the premium end of the market where it's looking to challenge companies like Samsung and Apple.
