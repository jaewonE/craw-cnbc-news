Samsung could add generative artificial intelligence technology to its voice assistant Bixby, a top executive at the company told CNBC, as the South Korean giant looks to enhance the appeal of its devices.
Bixby launched in 2017 with Samsung's Galaxy S8 smartphone. The software offered a number of functions, including live translations or restaurant recommendations.
But voice assistants have typically been less conversational and have relied on users asking questions and getting answers.
Chatbots are now more advanced and able to handle much more complex queries, after the emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT and its rivals. These new-age chatbots are an example of generative AI, which allows users to prompt with a query and will generate a response in the form of text, a picture, and now even video.
