Samsung Electronics on Friday said it expects to post a 931% increase in first quarter operating profit, as chip prices rebound.
Operating profit in the January-March quarter likely rose to 6.6 trillion Korean won ($4.89 billion), up 931% from a year ago, according to a preliminary statement. Profit in the first quarter of 2023 was 0.64 trillion won.
The profit guidance for the first quarter of 2024 exceeds LSEG's estimate of 5.24 trillion won.
"We forecast Samsung Electronics will post solid earnings for 1Q24 driven by memory price hikes and robust S24 sales, beating market estimates," said SK Kim, executive director and analyst at Daiwa Securities in a March 27 report.
"We expect the strong AI-driven memory upturn cycle will drive earnings in 2024-25E," said Kim. Daiwa maintained their "buy" rating on Samsung Electronics and lifted price target to 110,000 won.
