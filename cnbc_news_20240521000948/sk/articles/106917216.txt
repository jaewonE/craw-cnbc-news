SK Hynix said on Tuesday it expects strong memory chip demand to run on for the rest of 2021 on data center build-outs and the use of more sophisticated chips in smartphones, as it reported its biggestquarterly profit in more than two years.
SK Hynix, the world's second-biggest memory chipmaker with customers including Apple, forecast especially strong growth for NAND Flash products in the second half of the year due to demand for increased data storage in mobile devices.
"The demand level is much stronger than we expected early this year, especially from 5G-based smartphones and PCs," head of DRAM marketing MS Park said in an earnings call. "Such favourable memory market conditions are expected to continue into the second half of 2021."
