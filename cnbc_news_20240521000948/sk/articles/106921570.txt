SK Innovation confirmed plans to make its battery business a stand-alone unit, sending its shares down as much as much as 7.9% in morning trade to hit a near four-month low.
Analysts said investors were concerned that SK Innovation would be left with its less attractive conventional petrochemical business once the battery business is separated.
The owner of South Korea's top refiner SK Energy posted an operating profit of 506 billion won ($441 million) in the April-June quarter, compared with an operating loss of 456 billion won in the same period a year earlier.
The company said it expected refining margins to gradually improve in the second half as Covid-19 retreats and demand rebounded.
It would separate out its battery business and oil and gas production business into individual units by October. The new entities would continue to be wholly owned by SK Innovation.
"These split-offs are meant to preemptively strengthen fundamental competitiveness by building a management system suitable for the characteristics of each business," Kim Jong Hoon, SK Innovation's board chairman, said in a statement.
