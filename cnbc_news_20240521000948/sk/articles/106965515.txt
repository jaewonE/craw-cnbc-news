SK Hynix forecast steady growth in demand for memory chips on Tuesday as it posted its highest quarterly operating profit since 2018 on the back of rising prices which offset slowing personal computer sales as Covid-19 lockdowns eased.
"Despite the concerns over recent global supply chain disruptions," the chipmaker's third-quarter performance "signals that the semiconductor memory industry is continuing its growth momentum," SK Hynix CFO Kevin Noh said in a statement.
The world's second-biggest memory chipmaker, which serves customers including Apple, said operating profit rose to 4.2 trillion won ($3.6 billion) in the July-September quarter, up from 1.3 trillion won a year earlier.
