South Korea's SK Hynix, the world's no. 2 memory chipmaker, warned demand is likely to slow in the second half of the year as customers brace for recession, after booking its biggest second-quarter profit since 2018.
SK Hynix executives warned during an earnings call that customers are cutting costs noticeably and reducing investment out of recession concerns, hitting server chip demand and corporate PC demand, in addition to already slowing consumer demand for smartphones and PCs.
Server chips had been the only remaining bright spot in memory chip demand that drove SK Hynix to report a 56% jump in operating profit to 4.2 trillion won ($3.2 billion) in the April-June quarter, with large data center firms such as AmazonÂ meeting rising cloud demand.
"As a general trend, customers are holding more (memory chip) inventory for all applications" like PC, smartphone and servers, SK Hynix said. The firm's own inventory has gone up by about a week's worth of chip sales as of end-June compared with end-March.
Insight from key customers showed long-term demand for cloud services is still expected to expand, the company said. But short-term component shortages, macroeconomic uncertainty, and the hit to consumer-sector demand is turning server clients conservative in spending for the second half, SK Hynix said.
Given the uncertain environment, SK Hynix said it may decide on 2023 business plans as soon as late August and is looking at several scenarios, including a considerable reduction to its capital expenditure plans next year.
