South Korean memory chipmaker SK Hynix on Thursday reported a net profit of 1.92 trillion South Korean won ($1.39 billion) in the first quarter, reversing a loss of 2.58 trillion won logged in the same period a year ago.
This was the first positive income recorded since the third quarter of 2022, LSEG data showed. SK Hynix posted net losses for five consecutive quarters from a slump in the memory chip market.
Revenue in the first quarter stood at 12.43 trillion won, a 144% increase from a year ago. This was the highest revenue logged since second quarter 2022, according to LSEG data.
SK Hynix attributed the strong performance to an "increase in the sales of AI server products backed by its leadership in AI memory technology including high-bandwidth memory" as well as efforts to drive profitability.
SK Hynix is the world's second-largest memory chipmaker after Samsung Electronics and supplies high-bandwidth memory chips catering to AI chipsets for companies like Nvidia.
The explosive demand for AI chipsets boosted the high-end memory chip market, hugely benefiting players like SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics.
Large language models such as ChatGPT – which caused AI adoption to skyrocket – require a lot of high-performance memory chips as such chips allow these models to remember details from past conversations and user preferences in order to generate humanlike responses.
To meet AI memory demand, the firm said it plans to increase supply of HBM3E – the latest generation of high-bandwidth memory for AI. SK Hynix said it will also introduce 32GB Double Data Rate 5 products this year to strengthen its leadership in the high-capacity server DRAM market.
